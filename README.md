# ionic-notes-app

A simple Ionic multiplatform app, in which the user can create, edit and delete notes, which have are stored in Firebase Firestore.
To do that, the user must first sign up or log in using email and password. 

Besides all of the above, the user can add and remove notes from favourites. These favourite notes are, in case that the user is accessing the app from a native platform (Android or iOS), stored in a local SQLite database. This way, the user can access their notes on their mobile device without Internet connection.
